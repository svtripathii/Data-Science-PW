    "    We define a custom exception InsufficientFundsError, which inherits from the built-in Exception class. This exception takes two parameters: amount (the amount the user attempted to withdraw) and balance (the current account balance).\n",

    "    In the example usage, we create a BankAccount instance with an initial balance of $1000. We then attempt to withdraw $1500. Since the balance is insufficient, it raises an InsufficientFundsError, which we catch and print along with the custom error message.\n",
