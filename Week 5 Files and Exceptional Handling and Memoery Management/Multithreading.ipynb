    "    Concurrency: Multithreading enables multiple tasks to be executed concurrently, allowing a program to make better use of available system resources and potentially speed up execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Responsive GUIs: In graphical user interface (GUI) applications, multithreading helps maintain responsiveness by allowing time-consuming tasks (like I/O operations or processing large data) to be executed in separate threads, preventing the UI from becoming unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I/O-Bound Tasks: Multithreading is beneficial for I/O-bound tasks such as reading from or writing to files, network operations, and database queries. While one thread is waiting for I/O to complete, other threads can continue executing, making efficient use of CPU resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parallelism: Although Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents true parallel execution of multiple threads due to limitations in CPython's memory management, multithreading can still provide benefits in certain cases, especially for CPU-bound tasks, by allowing threads to run concurrently on multiple cores.\n",

However, since the counter += 1 operation is not atomic, the final value of counter depends on the interleaving of operations between the two threads.
